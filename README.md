Velocity Calculation

Based on Iteration 1, this was our estimated velocity: 

work done = estimated hours of work done = 10 work days * 4 hours per day = 40
work hours available = work hours available to get work done = hours available * # of people = (10 work days * 2 hours per day) * 6 = 20 * 6 = 60 hours

Velocity = work done/work hours availble = 40 hours/60 hours = **0.67**

This velocity would then be used to figure out how our work would flow for our second iteration.
